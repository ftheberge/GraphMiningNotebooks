    "Let $H=(V,E)$ a hypergraph, and consider its incidence matrix $B$ as defined in section 7.2. \n",
    "Consider also the dual hypergraph $H^*$, where the roles of nodes are hyperedges are swapped, \n",
    "namely the edges in $H$ are the nodes in $H^*$, \n",
    "and there is as edge two vertices in $H^*$ if the corresponding hyperedges in $H$ have a non-empty intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### s-walks and distances\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the concept of $s$-walks on a hypergraph as follows. A $s$-**walk** of length $k$ on $H$ is a sequences of edges $e_{i_0}, e_{i_1}, ..., e_{i_k}$ in $E$ such that \n",
    "all $|e_{i_{j-1}} \\cap e_{i_j}| \\ge s$ for $1 \\le j \\le k$ and all $i_{j-1} \\ne i_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $s$-**distance** $d_s(e_i,e_j)$ between edges $e_i$ and $e_j$ is the length of the smallest $s$-walk between those, if it exists (else the distance is usually considered as infinity, and its inverse is set to zero).\n",

    "The $s$-**diameter** for $E_s$ is the maximal shortest path length between all $e_i, e_j \\in E_s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other concepts can also be defined using $s$-walks. For example for distinct $e_i, e_j, e_k \\in E$, if there is a $s$-walk $e_i, e_j, e_k$, we say that they form an $s$-**wedge**, and if there is an $s$ walk $e_i, e_j, e_k, e_i$, we can say those form an $s$-**triangle** and from those, we can define the $s$-**clustering coefficients** as in section 1.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **nodes**, all definitions above follow by considering the **dual** hypergraph. For example, a $s$-walk is a sequence of adjacent nodes such that each consecutive node pair in the walk share at least $s$ hyperedges; all other concepts defined above follow directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### toy example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the toy example above, with $s=2$, the sequence of edges 1-2-0 is an $s$-path since edges 1 and 2 share nodes A and C, and edges 2 and 0 share nodes A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dual toy hypergraph, again with $s=2$, the sequence of nodes (edges in the dual) D-F-E is a $s$-path since nodes D and F are both incident to edges 3 and 4, and nodes F and E are both incident to edges 3 and 5. \n",
    "Another $s$-path (with $s=2$) is C-A-B.\n",
    "\n",
    "With $s=1$, this corresponds to a walk on the (unweighted 2-section) graph, while for $s \\ge 2$, this concept only applies to hypergraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we compute the distances between every pair of nodes (thus, using the $s$-walks on the dual). An infinite distance between a pair of nodes means that there is no $s$-path joining those.\n",

    "We see the correspondence between the $s=1$ and graph cases; moreover in those cases, we have a single connected component since every pairs of nodes is connected by a path.\n",
