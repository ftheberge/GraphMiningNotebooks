# Graph Mining Notebooks

Julia Notebooks and datasets to accompany the textbook ["Mining Complex Networks"](https://www.torontomu.ca/mining-complex-networks) by B. Kaminski, P. Pralat and F. Th√©berge.

## Software environment

Please make sure to install the Julia programming language and make its
exacutable discoverable from the command line. Code was tested under Julia Version 1.11.5 (2025-04-14).

Then, after cloning this repository to your local machine go to command line
and in the folder containing the Julia notebooks and Project.toml and Manifest.toml file
run the following command:

```
julia --project=. --eval "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
```

This will download and install all the packages required to work with our examples.

You can start Jupyter Notebooks either using `jupyter notebook` command
in the command line, or by running the:
```
julia --project=. --eval "using IJulia; notebook(dir=pwd())"
```
command (that starts Jupyter from within a Julia session).

Note that some of the notebooks require installing additional external libraries.
In this case please follow the additional installation instructions provided in them.
