Then, the following rules for spreading are applied: (i) in a given airport pandemic lasts only for one round and (ii) in the next round, with probability α, the pandemic spreads independently along the flight routes to the destination airports for all connections starting from this airport. Airports can interact with the pandemic many times, and the process either goes on forever or the pandemic eventually dies out. Our goal is to find the expected number of times a given airport interacted with the pandemic, which amounts to the sum over all airports of the expected number of times this airport has the pandemic.*\n",
